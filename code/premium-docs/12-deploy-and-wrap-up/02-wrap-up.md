# Wrap Up

Alright, congratulations! You've made it to the end of the course. This was not an easy course. We covered a lot of ground and we learned a lot of new things. I hope that you enjoyed it and that you learned a lot.

## What's Next?

If you are comfortable with what we have done in this course, then I would say that you are more than ready to look for a job as a fullstack MERN developer. Sure there are other things to learn, but nobody knows everything, even the most experienced developers. You can always learn more.

If you are not comfortable with what we have done in this course, then I would suggest that you go back and review the sections that you are not comfortable with. Not many instructors that sell courses would do this, but I also suggest going through some other courses and tutorials from other instructors. It's good to get different perspectives on things.

Continue to build your own projects. You could even take this project and make it your own. Add more features, make it look better, etc. The possibilities are endless.

Some other technologies that you may want to look into are:

- NextJS - Server-side rendering for React
- GraphQL - A query language for your API
- Gatsby - A static site generator for React

These are tools that can help you build even better applications.

Thank you so much for taking this course and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors!
